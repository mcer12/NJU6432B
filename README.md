# NJU6432B Library

This is an Arduino library for controlling the NJU6432B, an LCD driver. The library provides functions to manage the display buffer, send data, and control individual segments of the display.

## Basics


## Installation

1. Copy this repository to your arduino libraries folder.
2. Restart the Arduino IDE to ensure the library is recognized.
3. You should now see library examples in Arduino IDE

## Usage

### Constructor
NJU6432B(uint8_t dataPin, uint8_t clockPin, uint8_t enPin);

- `dataPin`: The pin connected to the data line of the NJU6432B.
- `clockPin`: The pin connected to the clock line of the NJU6432B.
- `enPin`: The pin connected to the enable line of the NJU6432B.

### Public Methods

#### `bool begin()`
Initializes the NJU6432B driver and allocates the display buffer.

#### `uint8_t* getBuffer()`
Returns a pointer to the display buffer.

#### `void setSegment(uint8_t segment, uint8_t state)`
Sets the state of a specific segment in the LED matrix.

- `segment`: The segment index (0â€“111).
- `state`: The state of the segment (`1` for on, `0` for off).

#### `void update()`
Sends the current display buffer to the NJU6432B.

#### `void clear()`
Clears the display buffer and resets the flag bits.

#### `void fill()`
Fills the display buffer with `1`s and resets the flag bits.
